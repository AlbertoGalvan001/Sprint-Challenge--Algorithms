#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) The while loop is dependent on the size of n, this would be Linear 0(n).

b) The for loop will run through the size of n 0(n), but the while loop will run through half, so it's quasilinear 0(n log n)

c) The function will run n times, returning the sum of the number of bunny ears for n bunnies, so it's also Linear 0(n)

## Exercise II
